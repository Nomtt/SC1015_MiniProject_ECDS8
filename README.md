## Problem Statement
Differentiated Thyroid Cancer, which arises from the follicular cells of the thyroid gland, is the most common form of thyroid cancer, accounting for over 90% of all cases. Notably, the challenge faced here is its unpredictability. Despite successful treatment, up to 30% of patients experience recurrence. Currently, recurrence risk is assessed based on physician experience and generalized clinical guidelines. While these methods are helpful, they may overlook the nuanced, individual-level factors that influence recurrence. 

- Are we able to predict recurrence of Thyroid Cancer based on individualsâ€™ physical attributes?
- Which model would be the best to predict it?

## Models Used
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-means clustering

## Conclusion

## What did we learn from this project?
