## Problem Statement
Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC), the most common thyroid cancer type, makes up over 90% of all cases. A key challenge is its unpredictability—despite treatment, up to 30% of patients face recurrence. Current risk assessments rely on physician experience and generalized clinical guidelines, which may miss individual-specific factors affecting recurrence.

- Are we able to predict recurrence of Thyroid Cancer based on individuals’ physical attributes?
- Which model would be the best to predict it?

## Models Used
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-means clustering

## Conclusion

## What did we learn from this project?
